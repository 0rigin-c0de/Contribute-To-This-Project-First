# Contribute-To-This-Project-First
If you have never contributed to any repository on GitHub, then contribute here in just simple steps.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contributing
- Click on the green `Code` button, then either the HTTPS or SSH option and, click the icon to copy the URL. Now you have a copy of the project. Thus, you can play around with it locally on your computer.

- Run the following commands into a terminal window (Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, Bash, ZSH). Do this to download the forked copy of this repository to your computer.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Contribute-To-This-Project-First.git
```

- Switch to the cloned folder. You can paste this command into the same terminal window.

```bash
  cd Contribute-To-This-Project-First
```

- Make a new branch. Your username would make a good branch because it's unique.

```bash
  git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>
```

Create a file named `your-username.yml` in the directory `public/data`.
Your brand new file should look something similar to this one:

```yml
name: Martin D velopers
job: Developers
skills:$
pythons
- perl$
- pascal$
```
- Stage your changes.

```bash
  git add .
```

- Commit the changes.

```bash
  git commit -m "Add <your-github-username>"
```

- Check the status of your repository.

```bash
  git status
```

- The response should be like this:

```bash
On branch <name-of-your-branch>
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

- Pushing your repository to GitHub.

```bash
  git push origin <name-of-your-branch>
```

or

```bash
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
```
